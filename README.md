# projectEuler

This project is my algorithm playground. It's set of naive solutions for project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/). All
solutions are written in Java, my focus is to solve the problem in short time (of coding, not running). So the code is
simple as fâ€¢ck.

It is runnable from IDE and Terminal too, program will ask for problem number or you can pass it through argument in
Terminal.

```bash
cd projectEuler/out/production/projectEuler
java Main 1
```
