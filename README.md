# projectEuler

This project is my algorithm playground. It's set of naive solutions for project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/). All
solutions are written in Java, my focus is to solve the problem in short time (of coding, not running). So the code is
simple as fâ€¢ck.

It is runnable from IDE and Terminal too, program will ask for problem number or you can pass it through argument in
Terminal.

## Clone the repo

```bash
# clone the code
git clone https://github.com/danmaslo/projectEuler.git

# cd into the built app
cd out/production/projectEuler
```

## Run the app

```bash
# run the app
java Main

# run the app for specific problem (number 13 for example)
java Main 13
```
